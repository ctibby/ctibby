# Hey There! I'm Chris Tibbitts 👋

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a data analytics enthusiast and a recent transplant to the bustling tech hub of Palo Alto, CA. Currently, I am thrilled to be working as a financial analyst at Stanford. I love diving deep into data to unearth insights that can transform businesses. But hey, life isn't all about data (or is it?). When I'm not wrestling with datasets, you can catch me spiking a volleyball on the beach, setting up camp in the wilderness, or carving fresh tracks in the snow.

## 🚀 About Me
- **New to Palo Alto**: Just relocated here and soaking up every bit of innovation and tech vibes this place has to offer.
- **Data Analytics Buff**: Skilled in Python, SQL, Power BI, and always on the lookout for the next cool data visualization tool.
- **GitHub Newbie**: Created this account to showcase some new projects, share my data-driven journey, and connect with the vibrant tech community.

## 🏐 Hobbies Galore
- **Beach Volleyball**: There's nothing like a game on the sand under the sunny California sky.
- **Camping/Backpacking**: Trading data models for trail maps on the weekends.
- **Riding Motorcycles**: There's nothing like the freedom of the open road.

## 💼 My Role
I'm currently leveraging my data analytics skills as a Financial Analyst at Stanford, focusing on transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.

Thank you for dropping by my GitHub profile. Looking forward to connecting with you!
